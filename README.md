# Rusty CHIP-8

This is a simple [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) simulator written in Rust. Third-party dependencies are to be kept to a minimum to allow portability across platforms. Special thanks to [Cowgod's CHIP-8 technical reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM) as it has been a great reference while working on this project.
